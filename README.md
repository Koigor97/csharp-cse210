This course is a 14 weeks semester course crunched to 7 weeks. This means every week, it's double the workload. Some programming languages are multi-paradigm, this means you can write your codes/programs in a Procedual way (line by line), Functional way (with functions), or with Objects (Classes/OOP). C# focuses more on Object Oriented Programming - OOP. And this course introduces the notion of classes and objects. Presenting the four core mechanics/principles of OOP - Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
